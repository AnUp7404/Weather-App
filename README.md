# Weather-App


The Weather App is a simple and user-friendly web application built using HTML and CSS. It allows users to get real-time weather updates for any city worldwide. The app fetches weather data from a public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and displays information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and current weather conditions in an intuitive and visually appealing interface.
